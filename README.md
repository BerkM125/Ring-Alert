# Ring-Alert
Programming and documentation for Ring Alert device.

## What is the Ring-Alert?
The Ring Alert is an all new wireless device system designed to help those struggling with Alzheimer's and more specifically,
the physical and vocal impairments that can arise in a patient due to Alzheimer's disease. With a push of a button from the main
device, any and all Ring Alert devices paired to the main device will ring a unique tone upon receiving a wireless transmission.
The source code was made to be adjustable and manipulated to suit different needs and variations of the device, for example:

1. Different ringtones
2. Multi-channel pairing
3. Transmission waiting interval
4. CE or CSN pinout adjustments
